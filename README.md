# ROD
A [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) dashboard to easily display the spreadsheet calculations seen on [Retire on Dividends](https://www.youtube.com/@RetireonDividends) in one place. Also used to track my portfolio


## Future Plans
- Fetch expense ratio for each symbol instead of asking for input
- Calculate dividend growth for future predictions
- Incorporate [Market Simulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPfw1y9Cj1Q) created by [Reaching Riches](https://www.youtube.com/@Reaching_Riches). This provides a more realistic simulation of the future market
